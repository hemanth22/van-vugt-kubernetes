In this step you're going to setup the storage backend for the loop device. You have to do 3 things in this step:
1.	Create a disk image file with the name /root/diskfile.img and a size of 8GiB (8192 MiB)
2.	Use this disk image file in a loop device
3.	Verify the loop device was created successfully
