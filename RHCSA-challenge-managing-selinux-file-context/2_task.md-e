In this task you're going to analyze SELinux denial messages. Make sure that you get detailed information about what is going on which can normally obtained from the systemd journal. You may have to install one or two additional packages to ensure its working. Important: if you need to install these packages, you'll need to run the lftp command again, because otherwise no messages have been used. Read the output, but don't change anything yet, you will do that in the next steps.
