In this task you're going to configure automount. Set up automount in such a way that when the directory /home/ldap/ldapuser1 is accessed, the NFS share localhost:/users/ldap/ldapuser1 is mounted, and when /home/ldap/ldapuser2 is accessed, localhost:/users/ldapuser2 is mounted. Ensure this works for no matter which other subdirectory that might exist in /home/ldap. Make sure your configuration is written to the files /etc/auto.master and /etc/auto.ldap.
