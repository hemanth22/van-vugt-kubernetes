Now that you have created the disk image file, use the following command to convert it into a loop device: `losetup -fP diskfile.img`{{execute}} In this command, the -f option uses the first unused loop device, and the -P option forces the kernel to scan and update the partition table after creating the loop device, so that you can immediately start using it. 

After creating the loop device, use the following command to verify its creation: `losetup -a`{{execute}}. You should see a device with the name /dev/loop0, which is going to be your disk device throughout this exercise. So where normally you would use /dev/sda or /dev/vda as the disk device, you'll now use /dev/loop0.
