# Setting up a Shared Group Environment

In this scenario you're going to set up a shared group environment. You'll first create two directories, as well as two groups with some user owners. Next, you'll make sure that the environment is set up in such a way that the users can work in the directories. Specific instructions are in the different tasks. Good luck!
