Now that the processes are running, let's observe what is going on. A convenient way to do so, it by just running the top utility: `top`{{execute}}

Observe what is going on, and in particular have a look at the dd processes. Once you've seen enough, type `q`{{execute}} to quit the top interface.

Another way to look at processes, is by using the ps command with some of its many options. Use `ps aux`{{execute}} to see a list of all processes. In particular, have a look at the second column, which contains the process ID (PID), and the third column, which is showing current CPU load.
