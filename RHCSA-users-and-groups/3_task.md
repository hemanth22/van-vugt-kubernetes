Now that you have created the directories as well as the groups and users, it's time to set the appropriate permissions. Do this according to the following requirements:
*	Group sales gets full access permissions to /data/sales
*	Group account gets full access permissions to /data/account
*	All new files that will be created in /data/sales and /data/account should be group-owned by the group owner of the directory
*	Only the owner of the files is allowed to delete the files
*	Others should have no access to the directories at all
*	User anna is head of the account department, and shoud be allowed to delete all files in /data/account
*	User linda is head of the sales department, and should be allowed to delete all files from /data/sales
