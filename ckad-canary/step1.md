## Task

Launch the following command to prepare the lab environment:
`launch.sh`{{execute}}

Before you can start this scenario, the environment needs to be started. Hang on while this is happening, and once you see a prompt type the following to test that the environment is up. If you get an error message, wait a few more minutes and try again:

`kubectl get all`{{execute}}

You have now confirmed that the Kubernetes cluster is operational. As the only preparation that is left, you'll now have to clone the course Git repository:

`git clone https://github.com/sandervanvugt/ckad`{{execute}}
