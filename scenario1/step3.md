## Task
Now first make sure you are in the git repository you've just cloned.
`cd kubernetes`{{execute}}

Now run the following script to set up the container runtime automatically. Setting up a container runtime is not on the CKA exam, which is why this task is automated with this script.
`./setup-container.sh`{{execute}}

Once the container layer has been set up correctly, run the following script to install the required Kubernetes tools:
`./setup-kubetools-ubuntu.sh`{{execute}}
